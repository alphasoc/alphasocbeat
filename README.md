# alphasocbeat

Alphasocbeat is a beat for the elastic stack. Its purpose is to download alerts generated by AlphaSOC Analytics Engine and ship them to elasticsearch.

# Setup / Installation

## Binaries

The latest alphasocbeat release can be found [here](https://github.com/alphasoc/alphasocbeat/releases).

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `alphasocbeat.yml` file. Beat specific configuration requires 3 values:
```
alphasocbeat:
  registry_file: checkpoint.yaml
  api_url: https://api.alphasoc.net
  api_key: <api_key>
```
`registry_file` is used to store `follow` value, which provides data continuation between beat restarts. It allows downloading alerts newer than last downloaded alert, to avoid data duplication.

`api_key` api key provided by AlphaSOC, allows downloading alerts from API.

## Index setup

To setup elastic index provided by alphasocbeat, run the following command:

```
./alphasocbeat setup
```

## Running alphasocbeat

# Logs

Alphasocbeat logs are stored in `./logs` directory.

# Dashboards 

Alphasocbeat comes with 2 dashboards:
- AlphaSOC Threat Hunter
- AlphaSOC Detailed View

By default dashboards are installed on running beat. Setting `setup.dashboards.enabled: false` disables that feature.
